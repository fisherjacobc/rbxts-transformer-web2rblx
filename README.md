## üì¶ Setup

### Installation

> [!WARNING]
> This package has not released 1.0.0 yet, please make sure you use the @next tag or it will not install

Get started by installing `rbxts-transformer-web2rblx`
```sh
npm install rbxts-transformer-web2rblx@next
yarn add rbxts-transformer-web2rblx@next
pnpm add rbxts-transformer-web2rblx@next
```

### Configuration

Add the transformer to your tsconfig.json, and include the `jsx.d.ts` file
```ts
{   
    "compilerOptions": {
        ...
        "plugins": [
			{
				"transform": "rbxts-transformer-web2rblx",
				"cssFilePath": "src/roblox.css",
			}
		]
    },
    "include": [..., "node_modules/rbxts-transformer-web2rblx/jsx.d.ts"]
}
```

Change `cssFilePath` to the path of your css file

## üöÄ Using This Package

- As of now, you can only list 1 css file
- You can manually write your own css stylings to use
- You can also use other tools that generate/compile to css

### Using with Tailwindcss

You can use this pacakge in conjunction with Tailwindcss ü•≥!

#### Install Tailwindcss
```sh
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```
(you can use the yarn and pnpm equivelants of course)

#### Configure your file paths
Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.
```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

#### Create an import file
This is **not** what you put in the tsconfig. This file is where you put in manually written css stylings, and where you put the tailwind utilities directive.
> [!TIP]
> I recommend not adding the `@tailwind base` or `@tailwind components` directive, as they clutter up the output file and don't really affect the transformer.
```css
@tailwind utilities
```

#### Start the Tailwind CLI build process
Run the CLI tool to scan your tsx files for classes and build your CSS.
```sh
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
```

#### Start using Tailwind!
You're all set!
